# Welding Defect Detector

## Objective

The Welding Defect Detector project aims to design and implement a robust welding defect detection model. This model will automatically identify and classify defects in welded components using computer vision algorithms and machine learning. The goal is to enable real-time defect detection and categorization, ultimately reducing the workload of Quality Control (QC) engineers in the manufacturing industry.

## Features

- Implement YOLOv5 to create a specialized model capable of detecting welding defects, such as crack and porosity, in welding images.
- Train the model on a diverse dataset containing annotated welding images to learn the distinctive features of each defect type.
- Design and develop a user-friendly web application using Streamlit.
- The web app will provide a simple and intuitive interface for users to upload welding pictures.
- Upon upload, the YOLOv5-based object detection model will analyze the images and identify any welding defects present.
